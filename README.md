# Nilamark

Nilamark is a PHP bookmark manager with nested folder capability created by Jacob Kauffmann at Nerd on the Street. The rationale for starting this project was largely based around existing self-hosted bookmark managers lacking the ability to organize bookmarks within multi-level folder structures (hence the name, which refers to manila folders.)

## Deploying

The app is still in alpha; the database must be created manually.
